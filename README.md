# Hotel_Booking_Analysis

This analysis is done by Morgan Allen, Edith Magana, Woo Seok Kim, Marisol Mondragon.

The goals for this notebook is to explore and analyze what causes a hotel booking to cancel. Once we are able to determine this, we then will use the important features to make a few models. Finally, we will ensemble these models to get the best working model.

The data set can be found at Kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand

In the notebook you will see our initial data cleaning and the pre-analyzation of columns. We then look into different models to support our analysis on which features tend to contribute for a customer to cancel their booking. We looked into the logistic regression model, the nearest neighbors model, and the XGBoost model.
